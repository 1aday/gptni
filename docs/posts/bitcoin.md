# What If Jesus Invented Bitcoin Wafers?

**Bitcoin shouldn't be viewed as just technology; it's more like a social contagion or a meme.** Its value is driven by collective belief and psychology, not traditional economics. Essentially, Bitcoin is a decentralized Ponzi scheme with built-in growth loops. It's achieved escape velocity to self-perpetuate, thanks to its limited supply cap, decreasing miner rewards, and the fact that coins get lost over time as people use it. As long s you continue to have a core group of hard core zelous retards that belive in bitcoin, it's gonna keep going up, and Bitcoin has a lot of hardcore zelous retards.

**So, what's gonna happen to Bitcoin?** Since miner rewards halve every four years, the amount of new Bitcoin entering the market decreases over time, making it even scarcer. Combine that with coins being lost, and you've got a shrinking supply. everything else the same, even if number of bitcoin adopters doensn't increase the shrinking supply will push the price per unit of bitcoin up. Not because it suddenly became more valueable but because there is less of it to go around. 

**The growth loop:** So now price just went up for no reason, but it becomes evidence that there is something to BItcoin and retards were right all along. Even though no one is still using bitcoin for anything. And now non-retards who didnt have bitcoin are feeling the FOMO and are like "oh shit, I need to get some bitcoin" and they buy bitcoin, some of them become full retards and start telling everyone they know about bitcoin, and they buy bitcoin, and they tell their friends, and they buy bitcoin, and they tell their friends, and they buy bitcoin, and so on. And then some of them might become non-retards and realize bitcoin is not acutally useful but now they are holding their Bitcoin bags and needs to pump the price, so they have just as much interest to spread the social contagion as the hardcore retards.

**Perspective** Bitcoin is almost as old as iPhone and still no single major usecase beside ransomware.

So ask yourself: **Will roughly the same amount of people be using 
Bitcoin in the next four years? (until the next halving)** Even if new money flow stagnates, the decreasing supply means the price per unit is likely to go up. If you think Bitcoin isn't gonna vanish or take a big hit in popularity, it's probably gonna increase in value.

## The Two Camps

### Bitcoin Maximalists vs Skeptics

On one side, you've got **Bitcoin maximalists** preaching that it's the future of money and will eventually replace traditional currencies. On the other side, **skeptics** dismiss it as just a fancy tech-wrapped Ponzi scheme.

### Missing the Point

Here's the thing though - they're both missing the point. **Bitcoin's value isn't rising because more people are using it as actual money** or even as a store of value. And even if Bitcoin is nothing more than an financial Rube Goldberg machine, that doesn't mean it can't keep going up in value.

The simplest way to think about it is this: **ask yourself if Bitcoin will be culturally more or significantly less relevant** (I'll explain why it has to be significantly less for the price to go down in a bit) over the next 4 years. If you think it'll maintain or grow its cultural relevance, you should probably buy some Bitcoin.


### The Simple Question

Bitcoin isn't just a meme as in funny internet pictures—it's a meme in Dawkins' original definition: **a self-replicating unit of cultural transmission**. Just like genes in biology, memes survive and spread through a population based on their "fitness" in capturing attention and belief.

Bitcoin doesn't need mass adoption to keep going up—it just needs enough true believers (call them Bitcoin maximalists) to keep the meme alive until the next wave of people jump in. And when that next cultural moment hits, the Bitcoin halving will have already made it even more scarce, plus more coins will be lost forever. So each Bitcoin becomes more valuable. Not because it's more useful, but because there's less of it to go around.


You can stop reading here, but if you still don't get it, here's the long version:

#Long version

Once a cultural meme hits escape velocity with enough true believers, it can survive basically forever with a surprisingly small number of followers. Check out these wild examples:

- **Zoroastrians**: Founded ~3,500 years ago, managed to survive multiple empires, wars, and persecutions, and still has 200,000 followers today
- **Samaritans**: Started around 2,800 years ago, survived countless conflicts and near extinction, and keeps going with just 850 people
- **Mandaeans**: Kicked off about 2,000 years ago, outlasted the Roman Empire, Islamic conquests, and modern wars, and maintains 60,000 believers

Now imagine if these small but dedicated religious groups had sacred artifacts that became increasingly scarce over time—ancient texts that crumbled to dust, holy relics that were lost or destroyed. Even with their dwindling numbers, the remaining artifacts would become exponentially more precious to the faithful. 


Which brings us to communion wafers...


# What If Jesus Invented Bitcoin? (A Weird but Useful Way to Understand Crypto)

## First, Let's Talk About the Communion Wafer

For those who don't know, the communion wafer is this super plain piece of bread that Catholic churches use during Mass. Literally just flour and water pressed into a tiny disc. But here's where it gets interesting: once a priest blesses it, Catholics believe it **literally becomes the body of Christ** through something called **transubstantiation**. Not symbolically—like, they actually think it's Jesus. Wild, right?

### The 2008 Communion Wafer Incident

Back in 2008, there was this crazy story where a college kid in Florida took one of these wafers home instead of eating it at church. People **LOST THEIR MINDS**. He got actual death threats over this. The Catholic League called it a "hate crime," and it became this huge deal—all over a tiny cracker that, scientifically speaking, is just bread.

But here's the thing: whether or not you believe the wafer is truly the body of Christ doesn't matter. **What matters is that a large group of people believe it is**, and that belief gives it immense value and significance.

Same with Bitcoin. Whether or not you believe it's the future of money doesn't matter. What matters is that a large group of people believe it is, and that group's belief is irrationally strong enough to keep holding on to it regardless of how much it's crashed and burned.

## So, How Does This Relate to Bitcoin?

Alright, now let's bring Bitcoin into the mix.

### If Jesus Invented Bitcoin

Imagine if Jesus had been like, "Okay, here's the deal with communion wafers:

- **There will only ever be 21 million of them.**
- **Each one can be broken into 100,000,000 pieces** (like Bitcoin's satoshis).
- **So that's 2.1 quadrillion total pieces possible.**
- **Every 4 years, we'll cut in half how many new ones we make** (similar to Bitcoin's halving schedule).
- **Also, if you lose one, it's gone forever—no replacements** (just like the estimated 20% of Bitcoin lost forever).

Now, imagine these wafers are central to a religion that's maintaining or even growing its number of followers. Over time, as wafers get used, lost, or destroyed, the total quantity decreases. But if the number of believers stays the same or increases, demand stays steady or goes up. **Less supply plus same or more demand equals higher value per wafer**.

---

## Scarcity, Divisibility, and Belief

By capping the number of wafers and allowing them to be divided into tiny pieces, Jesus would have introduced scarcity and accessibility into a religious practice. This mirrors how Bitcoin operates:

- **Scarcity**: Limited supply that becomes more scarce over time.
- **Divisibility**: You don't need to own a whole Bitcoin (or wafer); you can own a fraction, making it accessible to more people.

The power comes not just from scarcity, but from **belief**. If enough people believe in something, it has value, regardless of what it physically is.

---

## Halving and Decreasing Supply

Every four years, the production of new wafers is halved. This means that over time, fewer and fewer wafers are introduced into the system. In Bitcoin terms, this is known as the **"halving,"** and it's a key feature that contributes to Bitcoin's increasing scarcity.

- **Visualizing the Halving Effect**: Each halving reduces the reward miners get for adding new blocks to the blockchain, effectively slowing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created.
- **Price Correlation**: Historically, after each halving, Bitcoin's price has seen significant upward movement. As supply decreases and demand remains the same or grows, the price naturally goes up.

---

## Believers and Vested Interests

Now, here's where it gets even more interesting.

### Believers Spreading the Message

Just like in any religion, believers feel a duty to spread the word. Their conviction can seem overzealous to non-believers, but it doesn't matter. The more they evangelize, the more new people might adopt the belief, increasing demand.

- **Religious Duty**: Strong believers act with a sense of purpose, promoting adoption and acceptance.
- **Network Growth**: As more people join, the network effect strengthens, potentially increasing the value of each wafer/Bitcoin.

### Former Believers with Vested Interests

Even if someone stops believing, if they still hold some wafers (or Bitcoins), they have a vested interest in promoting it. They might hype it up, not out of faith, but because they stand to gain financially.

- **Incentive to Promote**: Personal holdings motivate individuals to encourage others to buy in, potentially driving up the price.
- **Market Dynamics**: This creates a unique situation where both true believers and former believers work towards the same goal—enhancing value.

### Increasing Power and Influence

Over time, those who hold significant amounts of Bitcoin have become wealthier and more influential as its value has risen.

- **Leverage to Influence**: Wealthy holders can fund projects, lobby for favorable regulations, or create platforms that further promote Bitcoin.
- **Parallel to History**: Similar to how influential figures have accelerated the spread of religions, big Bitcoin holders can boost its adoption, regardless of their personal beliefs.

## The Constantine Effect

Let's talk about **Emperor Constantine the Great** for a minute.

In the early 4th century, Constantine was the Roman Emperor who played a crucial role in the spread of Christianity. Before him, Christians were often persecuted. But when Constantine converted to Christianity (whether he truly believed or just saw it as a smart political move is up for debate), he granted it legal status with the **Edict of Milan** in 313 AD. This was a game-changer.

### Adoption by the Powerful

When a top person in society adopts a religion—or in our case, a technology like Bitcoin—it can gain long-term stability and widespread adoption.

- **Influence on the Masses**: Constantine's support led to Christianity spreading throughout the Roman Empire and beyond.
- **Legitimization**: His endorsement made Christianity respectable in the eyes of many who might have been on the fence.
- **Resource Allocation and vested interests**: With imperial backing, resources could be directed toward building churches, spreading the doctrine, and converting more people.

### Modern Parallels: Elon Musk and Nayib Bukele

Now, Elon and Nayib are just examples in this analogy—they're like the Constantines of today.

#### Elon Musk

- **Influence on Crypto**: When Elon tweets about Bitcoin or Dogecoin, the markets react. His company's investment in Bitcoin brought significant attention and legitimacy.
- **Shaping Perception**: As a tech visionary, his opinions can sway public perception and encourage adoption.

#### Nayib Bukele

- **Bitcoin as Legal Tender**: The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, made headlines by declaring Bitcoin legal tender in his country.
- **National Adoption**: This move forces businesses to accept Bitcoin, potentially increasing its use and legitimacy on a national scale.
- **Setting Precedent**: Other countries might follow suit, especially if they see benefits in El Salvador.

**Just Examples in the Analogy**

Elon and Nayib are modern parallels to Constantine in this context. Their adoption of Bitcoin doesn't guarantee its success, but it certainly boosts its visibility and legitimacy, just like Constantine did for Christianity.

## Branches of Christianity and Bitcoin Forks

Now, here's another layer to this analogy.

Just like Christianity branched out into various denominations over time—like Catholicism, Protestantism, Eastern Orthodoxy, etc.—Bitcoin has also experienced **forks**, leading to new cryptocurrencies.

### Branches of Christianity

- **Divergence of Beliefs**: Different interpretations and doctrines led to new denominations forming.
- **Continuation of Core Beliefs**: Despite differences, most branches still share core beliefs about Jesus and the Bible.

![Branches of Christianity](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6047d405b02148755fb6e601/18669f22-21af-4232-ab43-b5aa9aed7c1a/Major_Divisions_Within_Christianity.png)
*Major divisions within Christianity over time.*

### Bitcoin Forks

- **Reasons for Forking**: Disagreements over technical issues, block sizes, and visions for the future of the currency led to new versions like **Bitcoin Cash**, **Bitcoin SV**, and others.
- **Shared Origins**: Despite differences, these forks share the original Bitcoin protocol's foundation.

*A visual map of Bitcoin's forks over time.*

#### Bitcoin SV: Satoshi's Vision

One notable fork is **Bitcoin SV**, where "SV" stands for **Satoshi Vision**. The creators of Bitcoin SV believed that other forks were not following what Satoshi Nakamoto originally intended.

- **Religious Parallels**: Just as different Christian denominations claim to represent the true teachings of Jesus, various Bitcoin forks assert they are staying true to Satoshi's original vision.
- **Ideological Divides**: These splits highlight fundamental disagreements within the community, much like theological disputes in religions.

### Highlighting the Analogy

- **Schisms and Forks**: Both religions and cryptocurrencies experience splits when groups disagree on fundamental aspects.
- **Diversity and Competition**: These branches can lead to innovation and cater to different needs or beliefs.
- **Core Ideals Persist**: Even with variations, the original message or technology continues in each branch.

### Implications for Value

- **Belief Systems**: Just as different Christian denominations attract followers based on their interpretations, various Bitcoin forks attract users who align with their vision.
- **Investment Choices**: People might choose to "invest" their faith in a particular denomination or cryptocurrency based on which they believe has the best long-term prospects.
- **Survival of the Fittest**: Over time, some branches may fade while others thrive, depending on adoption and support.

## Conclusion: So, What's Gonna Happen to Bitcoin?

Since miner rewards halve every four years, the amount of new Bitcoin entering the market decreases over time, making it even scarcer. Combine that with coins being lost every year—forgotten passwords, lost wallets—and you've got a shrinking supply.

So, all you gotta ask is: **Will roughly the same amount of people be using Bitcoin in the next four years?** Even if new money flow stagnates, the decreasing supply means the price per unit is likely to go up. If you think Bitcoin isn't gonna vanish or take a big hit in popularity, it's probably gonna increase in value.

Analyzing whether Bitcoin will go up or down purely based on traditional fundamentals misses the bigger picture. Bitcoin can become more valuable without fitting into conventional economic models because its value is tied to **collective belief**, **vested interests**, **social dynamics**, and **influential backers**.

When pondering Bitcoin's future, consider:

- **Will enough people continue to believe in and use Bitcoin?**
- **Do holders (believers and non-believers) have incentives to promote and support it?**
- **Are influential figures or institutions adopting and pushing Bitcoin?**
- **Is the Bitcoin "meme" continuing to spread?**
- **Does the decreasing supply contribute to increased scarcity?**
- **Are the believers and vested non-believers becoming more powerful over time?**

If the answers lean toward "yes," then it's reasonable to expect that the value per Bitcoin could increase over time.

## The Genius of Bitcoin

The genius of Bitcoin isn't just the technology—it's that **Satoshi Nakamoto figured out how to create digital scarcity and get enough people to believe in it**. It's backed by math, but driven by belief. Just like religions have done with physical objects forever, except this time it's supported by cryptography instead of miracles.
